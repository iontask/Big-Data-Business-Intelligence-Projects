## Report on Tourist Accommodation Establishments

This project provides a detailed analysis of tourist accommodation establishments in 2010, created using Power BI. The report explores the distribution of establishments based on their star rating, geographic location across provinces, and main categories (hotels, inns, guest houses, etc.). It aims to offer insights into the geographic and qualitative distribution of tourism infrastructure and serves as a foundation for strategic decision-making in the tourism sector.
